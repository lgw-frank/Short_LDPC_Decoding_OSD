Training and Testing Recipe:

1) In directory:./Training_data_gen_128 with Main_train.py, generate training data for samples with designated batch_size say 100 and batch_num say 1000 for the (128,64) code, yielding an output file *.tfrecord 
2) In directory:./Ldpc_128_training with ldpc_128_training.py, training NMS-1 decoding scheme feeding in above generated data, yielding a tuned parameter, as well as an output file named *retrain.tfrecord, which records the track of all failed cases in decoding. That is, for each case, all LLR outputs at each iteration will be saved instead just the last iteration, which acts as the feedings for later employment of machine learning.
3) In directory:./DL_Training_serial with Main_DL.py, deep learning technique, such as CNN, RNN toggle switch is applied with feeding data from step 2, where the porposal is to tune the output LLR of failed decodings so that they can be adapted for further re-decoding attempt. As a result, its outcome is a fine-tuned model with trained parameters saved on files in current directory ./ckpts/*. Meanwhile, a decoding path is decided by the simulation result after traversing all cases of input file. Lastly, the second sliding-window model is trained to solve the problem of how to terminate decoding elegantly.
    
4) In directory:Testing_data_gen_128 with Main_test.py,, generate testing data per SNR point of interest.

5) In directory:Ldpc_128_testing with ldpc_128_tesing.py, the trained NMS decodes the data files in step 4 and generates a group of new data files each of which records the  decoding failures per SNR point of interest.

6) In directory:./DL_OSD_Testing_serial with Main_DL_OSD.py, veriy the effectiveness of trained models across a spectrum of metrics such as FER, number of TEPs, time delay etc. for each tested SNR point. 
7) To calculate the product of FERs in steps 5 and 6 for respective SNR point, thus obtaining the ultimate FERs curve, among other metrics.
