We reimplemented the ideas presented in the refered paper accordding to the steps described in Python strictly, for the purpose
of comparing its performance with the decoding scheme we proposed cross a spectrum of metrics including frame error rate (FER) , complexity, 
time delay etc. Notably, all comparisons are in the context of NMS decoding failures, that is the configuration of two-phase decoding
like NMS+post-processing variant, where the second component is PB_OSD here. Again, part credits of some code snippets are contributed 
to their original owners definitely, we promise to  reuse  them for academic purpose only. Surely we are not intended to infringe any 
intellectual property right, please contact us for immediate corrections if any. 
       
The entry function is defined in Main_PB_OSD.py file. To customize it to your scenario, just follow the listed steps 
(Assume Spyder IDE run in Anaconda for Win10):
1) Check and make sure all Python packages in each file of subdirectory are installed; 
2) In Main_PB_OSD.py, set the arguments in line 13 like this. However, it has to be aligned with the settings in 
module Ldpc_128_testing:
    sys.argv = "python 2.0 3.0 6 1 12 CCSDS_ldpc_n128_k64.alist NMS-1".split()
Concretely, batch_size=1 for PB_OSD due its strict TEP processing mode, and other settings mus align with those in the Module Ldpc_128_testing.
3 ) In line 491 and line 498 of function definiton calculate_two_thresholds of pb_testing.py, two key threshold conditions are adapted for better
frame error rate (FER) to match our proposed where the original settings in the neighborhood are commented out. The paied cost is the enlarged size of 
traversed TEPs or lengthy time delay.
4) In line 45-47  of globalmap.py file, three switches can be on/off to customize our scenario to the need of generating the FERs for the ideal, 
conventional OSD and PB based OSD decoders respectively:
    set_map('convention_osd',False)
    set_map('miracle_view',False)    
    set_map('pb_osd',True)   
5) Click the 'Run file' button in the menu of Spyder, it is expected PB_OSD will start off. Unfortunately, the process may require much time
compared with what we proposed. In the worst-case, it may stagnate into finding the optimal via traversing all the TEPs available for specific received
sequences before declaring early termination, which costs much elapsed time.
And after testing is done, the obatained FER for each SNR is multiplied by the known FERs of NMS respectively to yield the comprehensive FER performance
of the two-phase decoding configuration.

Caveat:  The patience is in need to collect sufficiently many decoding failure of PB_OSD to ensure the FER stability. In our experience, at least 10 hours
were expected to secure the number of decoding failures above 100 for PB_OSD post-processing  at each SNR point.
