The entry function is defined in Main_DL_OSD.py file. To customize it to your scenario, just follow the listed steps 
(Assume Spyder IDE run in Anaconda fo Win10):
1) Check and make sure all Python packages in each file of subdirectory are installed; 
2) In Main_DL_OSD.py, set the arguments in line 13 like this. Most of these arguments have to be aligned with the settings in 
modules Ldpc_128_testing, considering the model will be fed with NMS decoding failures which are generated in module Ldpc_128_testing.
    sys.argv = "python 2.0 3.0 6 100  12 CCSDS_ldpc_n128_k64.alist NMS-1".split()
3 ) Same as other modules, the settings in the function global_setting(argv) of globalmap.py have to be adapted or twiddled  for better performance, and some of them have to in line with the settings in the related modules. Say
    set_map('threshold_sum',3)     #equivalent to the order p in conventional OSD.
    set_map('training_snr',2.7)     #match training scenario in modules of DL_Training_serial and Ldpc_128_training
    set_map('segment_num',6)        #match the setting in module of DL_Training_serial
    set_map('soft_margin',0.9)      #Twiddled to balance FER vs. complexity
    set_map('decoding_length',30)    #match the setting in module of DL_Training_serial
    set_map('sliding_win_width',5)  #match the setting in module of DL_Training_serial

4) In lines 93 and 115 of the same file, the setting of restore_model_step = 'latest' will loaded the parameters trained well for 
CNN model and sliding window model respectively

5) Click the 'Run file' button in the menu of Spyder, it is expected the testing of FER on various SNR points will start off.
   
Notice: The FERs will be recorded in a text file for later retrieval, besides real-time rendering on screen.
