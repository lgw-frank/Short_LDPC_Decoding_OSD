# Short_LDPC_Decoding_OSD
The source code was uploaded and subject to updates occasionally. The project is about how to boost FER of short LDPC codes by the combination of normalized min-sum and ordered statistics decoding variant supported by two simple neural network models. A training and testing recipe in ./LDPC_128 was given to guide interested readers to replicate all decoding results in my submitted paper, a condensed merge of https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.06575 and https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14165. Besides, the authors strongly recommend to read the How_to_use_info file in each module of ./LDPC_128/Module_name/ for proper usage. For any readers interested in replicating the decoding results, please not hesitate to leave a note to lgw.frank@gmail.com when puzzled.
