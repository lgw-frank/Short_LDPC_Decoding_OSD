# Short_LDPC_Decoding_OSD
The source code will be uploaded in a few days. It's about how to boost FER of short LDPC codes by the combination of normalized min-sum and ordered statistics decoding variant supported by two simple neural network models. A training and testing recipe will be given to guide interested readers to replicate all decoding results in my submitted paper, a condensed merge of https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.06575 and https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14165
